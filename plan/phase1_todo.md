# Phase 1 Remaining Tasks - Completion Checklist

**Assessment Date:** September 19, 2025 16:20
**Current Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Near Complete - Critical gaps identified in action execution
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundations (Core CLI & Browser Automation)

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 audit reveals that while the core architecture is solid (93% test coverage, clean TypeScript), there are **critical integration gaps** preventing full functionality:

1. **Translation â†” Execution Gap**: Commands are translated to actions but never executed in browser
2. **Test Failures**: 6 failing tests due to async/sync mismatches and configuration issues
3. **Missing Action Executor**: No system to take translated actions and execute them via Playwright

## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Enhanced Integration

### 7. Database Integration Completion

+ [ ] **Add Execution Result Storage** (`src/db.ts`)
  - [ ] Extend TestResult interface to include execution status
  - [ ] Add execution timestamp and duration tracking
  - [ ] Store browser action outcomes (success/failure/error)
  - [ ] Implement execution history querying capabilities

+ [ ] **CLI Database Integration** (`src/cli.ts`)
  - [ ] Store test run results with execution outcomes
  - [ ] Add --history flag to view previous execution results
  - [ ] Implement result comparison between runs
  - [ ] Add cleanup commands for old execution data

### 8. Error Handling & Recovery

+ [ ] **Browser Error Handling** (`src/executor.ts`)
  - [ ] Implement timeout handling for browser operations
  - [ ] Add retry logic for failed browser actions
  - [ ] Handle browser crashes and automatic restart
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for network issues

+ [ ] **CLI Error Reporting** (`src/cli.ts`)
  - [ ] Add structured error output with exit codes
  - [ ] Implement error categorization (translation, execution, browser)
  - [ ] Add helpful error messages with suggested solutions
  - [ ] Create debug mode with detailed error traces

### 9. Performance & Resource Management

+ [ ] **Browser Resource Optimization** (`src/browser.ts`)
  - [ ] Implement browser instance pooling for efficiency
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and cleanup
  - [ ] Optimize page creation and disposal
  - [ ] Implement headless/headed mode configuration

+ [ ] **Concurrent Execution Support** (`src/executor.ts`)
  - [ ] Add support for parallel action execution
  - [ ] Implement action dependency analysis
  - [ ] Add resource locking for conflicting actions
  - [ ] Create execution queuing system

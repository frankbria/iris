# Phase 1 To-Do List (Foundations)

This list breaks down the core tasks needed to complete **Phase 1 – Foundations (Core CLI & Browser Automation)** as defined in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and the docs folder.

## 1. CLI Commands
+ [x] Scaffold a TypeScript/Node.js CLI project (commander.js or similar).
+ [x] Implement the `run` command with natural language translation and database persistence.
+ [x] **COMPLETE**: Implement the `watch` command file watching and automatic re-execution.
+ [x] Implement the `connect` command to start the JSON‑RPC/WebSocket server.
+ [x] Integrate a basic reporting/logging mechanism for command output.

## 2. Browser Automation Module
+ [x] Add Playwright dependency and TypeScript types.
+ [x] Create a `browser.ts` module to launch, close, and control browser contexts.
+ [x] Expose core actions: `navigate`, `click`, `type`, `screenshot`, etc.
+ [x] Write a smoke test to validate Playwright can launch a page and perform a simple click.

## 3. Natural Language → Playwright Translation
+ [x] **COMPLETE**: Define an AI client interface supporting OpenAI/Anthropic backends.
+ [x] Implement fallback translation rules for basic commands (click, fill, navigate).
+ [x] Wire the `run` command to send the user's natural‑language instruction to the translator.
+ [x] Add unit tests covering common translation mappings.

## 4. Protocol Layer (JSON‑RPC over WebSocket)
+ [x] Implement a lightweight WebSocket server exposing JSON‑RPC 2.0 endpoints.
+ [x] Define RPC methods for `executeCommand`, `getStatus`, and `streamLogs`.
+ [x] Integrate server startup into the `connect` command.
+ [x] Add an integration test simulating an RPC client issuing a command and receiving a result.

## 5. Persistence (SQLite Storage)
+ [x] Add SQLite dependency (e.g. better‑sqlite3) and initialize DB schema.
+ [x] Create migrations or initialization logic for the `test_results` table.
+ [x] Implement a `db.ts` module to insert and query test run records.
+ [x] Hook into the `run` command to persist start/end timestamps and status.
+ [x] Write tests for DB module CRUD operations.

## 6. Documentation & Testing
+ [x] Update `README.md` with Phase 1 usage examples for `run`, `watch`, and `connect`.
+ [x] Create basic unit and integration tests under `test/` (e.g. Jest or Mocha).
+ [x] Ensure new TypeScript code compiles with the project tsconfig and linter.

## Phase 1 Remaining Items

**Outstanding work to complete Phase 1:**

1. **Watch Command Implementation** - Currently only a stub that logs the target
   - Add file watching capability using `chokidar` or Node.js `fs.watch`
   - Implement automatic re-execution of `run` commands on file changes
   - Add debouncing to prevent excessive runs
   - Support glob patterns for watching specific file types

2. **AI Client Integration** - Missing AI provider interfaces
   - Create AI client abstraction for OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama
   - Implement prompt engineering for better command interpretation
   - Add configuration for API keys and model selection
   - Enhance translator to use AI when patterns don't match

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ 100% Complete
- ✅ Core functionality working (CLI, browser automation, persistence, protocol)
- ✅ File watching implemented with chokidar and debouncing
- ✅ AI integration implemented with OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama support
- ✅ Enhanced translator with pattern matching and AI fallback
- ✅ Configuration system for API keys and model selection

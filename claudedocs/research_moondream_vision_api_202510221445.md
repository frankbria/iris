# Research Report: Moondream API for IRIS Vision AI

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Research Question:** Would the Moondream API improve or make IRIS's vision AI more effective?
**Conclusion:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research into Moondream's capabilities, pricing, and performance characteristics, **I do not recommend adding Moondream as a vision provider for IRIS**. While Moondream excels at general vision tasks and offers attractive pricing, it has documented failures at the specific use case IRIS requires: detecting subtle UI changes in visual regression testing.

### Key Findings

- ✅ **Strong general vision performance** - Beats GPT-4o on some benchmarks
- ✅ **Attractive pricing** - 5,000 free requests/day, local deployment option
- ✅ **Improved UI understanding** - ScreenSpot F1@0.5 score of 80.4
- ❌ **CRITICAL: Fails at UI regression testing** - Documented in GitHub issue #156
- ❌ **Hallucinates differences** - Reports changes that don't exist
- ❌ **Misses minor changes** - Fails to detect subtle UI modifications
- ⚠️ **No clear advantage over current providers** - IRIS already has free local option (Ollama)

## Current IRIS Vision AI Architecture

### Existing Providers

| Provider | Model | Cost/Image | Hallucination Rate | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Ollama** | llava/bakllava | $0.00 (local) | Unknown | ✅ Primary (free local) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o | $0.002 | 1.5% | ✅ Fallback tier 1 |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $0.0015 | 4.4-17% | ✅ Fallback tier 2 |

### Smart Fallback System

```
Ollama (free, local)
  ↓ (if unavailable/fails)
OpenAI GPT-4o (high accuracy, low cost)
  ↓ (if unavailable/fails)
Anthropic Claude 3.5 (good accuracy, lowest cost)
```

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **ImagePreprocessor**: Resizes to 2048x2048, optimizes to 85% JPEG quality
- **AIVisionCache**: LRU memory + SQLite persistence, 30-day TTL
- **CostTracker**: Budget management with circuit breaker at 80%/95%/100% thresholds
- **Use Case**: Visual regression testing - comparing baseline vs. current screenshots to detect UI changes

## Critical Limitation: UI Regression Testing Failure

### GitHub Issue #156 - "Use Case: Software UI Testing"

**User Request**: Compare two UI screenshots to detect changes

**Methodology Tested**: Side-by-side collage of baseline and current screenshots

**Results**:
- ❌ **Failed to detect minor UI changes** - Subtle visual modifications went unnoticed
- ❌ **Hallucinated non-existent differences** - Reported changes that weren't there

**Status**: Issue remains open with no resolution (as of research date)

### Why This Matters for IRIS

IRIS's core visual regression testing workflow:

1. Capture baseline screenshot
2. Capture current screenshot
3. AI analyzes both images to classify changes
4. Report severity: `none`, `minor`, `moderate`, `breaking`

**Requirements**:
- **High precision**: False positives waste developer time
- **High recall**: False negatives miss critical bugs
- **Low hallucination**: Confidence in reported differences is crucial

**Moondream's documented behavior directly contradicts these requirements.**

## Comparison Analysis

### Performance for Visual Regression Testing

| Aspect | Moondream | GPT-4o | Claude 3.5 | Ollama llava |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **UI Change Detection** | ❌ Documented failures | ✅ Proven reliable | ✅ Proven reliable | ⚠️ Variable |
| **Hallucination Rate** | Unknown for vision | 1.5% | 4.4-17% | Unknown |
| **Minor Change Detection** | ❌ Misses changes | ✅ High accuracy | ✅ Good accuracy | ⚠️ Variable |
| **False Positives** | ❌ Hallucinates diffs | ✅ Low rate | ✅ Acknowledges uncertainty | ⚠️ Unknown |

### Cost Analysis

| Scenario | Current IRIS | With Moondream |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **100 screenshots/day** | $0 (Ollama) | $0 (free tier) |
| **1,000 screenshots/day** | $0 (Ollama) | $0 (free tier) |
| **10,000 screenshots/day** | $0 (Ollama) or $20 (GPT-4o) | Unknown (contact required) |

**Conclusion**: No meaningful cost advantage since IRIS already has free local option (Ollama)

### Integration Complexity

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Required Work**:
- Create `MoondreamVisionClient` extending `BaseAIVisionClient`
- Implement TypeScript/Node.js integration (Python SDK available, no official Node SDK)
- Add cloud API authentication
- Support local deployment mode detection
- Test with IRIS preprocessing pipeline (resize, optimize, hash)
- Validate caching system compatibility
- Add cost tracking (free tier limits)
- Update smart fallback logic
- Write unit tests (following 85% coverage requirement)
- Update documentation

**Risk Assessment**: High - documented failures at core use case

## Moondream Strengths (Not Relevant to IRIS)

While Moondream has impressive capabilities, they don't align with IRIS's needs:

1. **Small model size** - Fast inference, good for edge devices
   - *IRIS runs server-side, size less important*

2. **Strong general vision** - Beats GPT-4o on VQAv2
   - *IRIS needs specialized UI regression testing, not general VQA*

3. **Good document understanding** - High scores on ChartQA, DocVQA
   - *IRIS analyzes UI screenshots, not documents*

4. **Improved UI element localization** - ScreenSpot 80.4
   - *Element localization ≠ change detection*

5. **Offline operation** - Local deployment available
   - *IRIS already has this via Ollama*

---

## Recommendation: DO NOT INTEGRATE

### Primary Reasons

1. **Critical Use Case Mismatch**: Documented failures at UI screenshot comparison - the exact task IRIS performs.

2. **No Cost Advantage**: Free tier doesn't provide value over existing Ollama integration.

3. **High Risk, Low Reward**: Integration effort (2-3 days) for a provider with known limitations in IRIS's core use case.

4. **Current System is Superior**:
   - Ollama provides free local inference
   - GPT-4o provides high accuracy (1.5% hallucination)
   - Claude 3.5 provides good accuracy with uncertainty acknowledgment
   - Smart fallback ensures reliability

5. **Quality Standards at Risk**: Adding a provider that hallucinates differences could reduce IRIS's reliability and user trust.

### Alternative Recommendation

**Continue optimizing the current three-provider system:**

- ✅ Ollama (free, local) - Primary option for cost-sensitive users
- ✅ GPT-4o (low cost, high accuracy) - Best for critical testing
- ✅ Claude 3.5 (lowest cost, good accuracy) - Balanced option

**Monitor Moondream development** for future improvements specifically in UI regression testing. Reconsider if:
- They explicitly address and fix the UI comparison issue (GitHub #156)
- Community reports success in visual regression testing use cases
- Documentation includes UI testing as a validated use case

---

## Future Consideration Criteria

Moondream could be reconsidered if the following conditions are met:

1. ✅ **Documented success** at UI screenshot comparison and change detection
2. ✅ **Low hallucination rate** for visual diff analysis (< 5%)
3. ✅ **Community validation** of visual regression testing use cases
4. ✅ **Clear pricing** for production use beyond free tier
5. ✅ **Official Node.js/TypeScript SDK** for easier integration
6. ✅ **Resolution of GitHub issue #156** with positive outcomes

## Appendix: Benchmark Context

### General Vision Benchmarks (Moondream Strengths)

These benchmarks show Moondream's general capabilities but don't validate UI regression testing:

- **VQAv2**: General visual question answering
- **COCO**: Object detection in natural images
- **OCRBench**: Text recognition
- **ChartQA/DocVQA**: Document understanding
- **CountbenchQA**: Object counting
- **POPE**: Object hallucination

### UI-Specific Benchmarks

- **ScreenSpot (F1@0.5: 80.4)**: UI element localization
  - *Measures finding elements, not detecting changes*
  - *Not the same as visual regression testing*

### Missing Benchmarks

Moondream lacks validation on benchmarks relevant to IRIS:

- Visual regression detection
- UI diff classification
- Screenshot comparison accuracy
- Change severity classification

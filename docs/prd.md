# AI-Driven UI Development Orchestrator - Refined PRD

**Version:** 1.1

**Date:** 2025-09-18

**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Executive Summary

The AI-Driven UI Development Orchestrator gives your AI coding assistant **eyes and hands** to actually see and interact with the UI it's helping you build. Built for solo developers who already use AI tools like Claude, Cursor, or Copilot, this tool eliminates the frustrating gap where AI can write code but can't verify if the UI actually works.

## Target User & Market

### Primary User: The "Vibe Coder"

- Solo developer or small team
- Already using AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
- Ships fast, iterates often
- Values velocity over process
- Frustrated that AI can't "see" what it builds

### Why Now?

- AI coding tools have 10x'd code generation
- But UI verification remains manual
- Developers trust AI for logic but need eyes on UI
- The gap between "code complete" and "actually works" is painful

### Success Metrics (3-Month)

- 1,000+ GitHub stars
- 100+ daily active developers
- 10+ "How I use Orchestrator" blog posts
- 3+ acquisition inquiries or job offers
- Clear path to $10K MRR

### What This IS

- An AI that can **see and interact with your UI** while you code
- A development companion that **evaluates UX decisions** in real-time
- A tool that **discovers and tests user flows** autonomously
- A bridge that gives AI coding assistants **eyes and hands** for UI work

### What This IS NOT

- Just another test automation framework
- A replacement for manual QA
- A code generator
- A deployment tool

## Refined User Stories

### 1. AI-Driven UI Exploration

**As a developer**, I want AI to explore my UI and discover potential issues or improvements, **so that** I catch problems before writing explicit tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AI autonomously navigates through the application
- Identifies broken flows, dead ends, or confusing interactions
- Suggests improvements based on UX best practices
- No explicit test writing required

### 2. Real-Time Development Feedback

**As a developer**, I want AI to watch my UI changes and provide instant feedback, **so that** I can iterate faster with confidence.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- UI changes trigger immediate AI evaluation
- AI provides contextual suggestions (e.g., "This button contrast is too low")
- Feedback appears in CLI within 2 seconds of change
- AI can demonstrate issues by interacting with the UI

### 3. Natural Language UI Validation

**As a developer**, I want to describe desired behavior in plain English, **so that** AI can verify it works without me writing selectors or assertions.

**Example Commands:**

- "Make sure users can complete checkout"
- "Verify the modal is accessible"
- "Check if the form validation makes sense"

### 4. Design System Compliance

**As a design lead**, I want AI to verify UI compliance with our design system, **so that** consistency is maintained automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AI recognizes design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Flags deviations from established patterns
- Suggests correct implementations
- Works with popular design systems (Material, Ant, custom)

### 5. Intelligent Visual Regression

**As a QA engineer**, I want AI to understand the *intent* behind visual changes, **so that** I only get alerted about meaningful regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AI distinguishes between intentional redesigns and bugs
- Understands context (e.g., "button moved but function preserved")
- Severity based on user impact, not pixel difference

## Simplified Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

```
CLI <-> Orchestrator Core <-> Playwright
         |
         v
    AI Interpreter (OpenAI/Claude API)

```

**Deliverables:**

- Basic CLI (`orc watch`, `orc explore`, `orc check`)
- Playwright browser automation
- Simple AI command interpreter
- File watcher for development mode

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)

```
Add: Vision AI <-> UI Screenshot Analysis
     Pattern Recognition <-> Local Learning Cache

```

**Deliverables:**

- Visual understanding of UI elements
- Design pattern recognition
- Smart waiting and retry strategies
- Basic accessibility checks

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 9-12)

```
Add: Tool Bridges (JSON-RPC/MCP)
     Real-time Feedback Loop

```

**Deliverables:**

- Claude Code, Warp, Codex adapters
- Bi-directional context sharing
- Streaming feedback to IDEs

---

## Simplified Technical Stack

### Core Dependencies Only

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20+ with TypeScript
- **Browser:** Playwright (cross-browser support)
- **AI:** OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (with local Ollama option)
- **Storage:** SQLite for results and patterns
- **Protocol:** JSON-RPC 2.0 for tool communication

### Avoid Early Complexity

- ‚ùå No vector DB initially (use simple JSON cache)
- ‚ùå No Prometheus metrics (use simple counters)
- ‚ùå No complex migration system (versioned schemas)
- ‚ùå No Rust optimization (pure TypeScript is fine)

---

## Development Priorities (Solo Developer Focus)

### Week 1-2: Prove the Magic

**Goal:** Show that AI can meaningfully understand and interact with UIs

**Core Features:**

- Basic CLI with watch mode
- OpenAI Vision API integration (BYOK)
- Simple natural language ‚Üí Playwright actions
- Local web view showing what AI "sees"

**Demo:** "Watch AI fix my broken form validation"

### Week 3: Make it Delightful

**Goal:** Polish that makes developers want to share

**Features:**

- Beautiful CLI output (colors, emojis, animations)
- Smart suggestions with code snippets
- Screenshot annotations showing issues
- One-line npx installation

**Demo:** "AI found 3 accessibility issues I missed"

### Week 4: Launch Strong

**Goal:** Create momentum and community

**Deliverables:**

- 3 viral demo videos
- Launch on Product Hunt, HackerNews
- Open source with great README
- Discord community setup

**Demo:** "I let AI explore React.dev and here's what it found"

### Month 2-3: Community & Polish

- Add Claude MCP integration
- Support more AI providers (Gemini, local models)
- Plugin system for custom checks
- Orchestrator Cloud waitlist

### Key Technical Decisions

**Simplicity First:**

- No vector DB (use simple JSON cache)
- No complex schemas (keep it flat)
- No metrics/observability initially
- SQLite only for history

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model:**

```bash
# User provides their API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
npx orchestrator watch --url http://localhost:3000

```

**Progressive Disclosure:**

- Works with zero config
- `-verbose` for debugging
- Config file for power users
- Plugins for extensibility

## Open Questions for Resolution

1. **Licensing Model:** Open source with commercial tier, or fully open?
2. **AI Provider Strategy:** Multi-provider or optimize for one?
3. **Configuration Philosophy:** Convention over configuration, or highly customizable?
4. **Distribution Method:** NPM package, binary, or Docker container?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate core hypothesis:** Build POC showing AI can meaningfully evaluate UI
2. **User interviews:** Talk to 10 developers about their UI testing pain points
3. **Technical spike:** Test Playwright + Vision AI integration performance
4. **Community engagement:** Share concept, gather feedback
5. **Begin Phase 1:** Start with foundation components

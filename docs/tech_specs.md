# Technical Specifications

**Project:** AI-Driven UI Development Orchestrator

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-09-18

---

## 1. Overview

The AI-Driven UI Development Orchestrator is a CLI-based tool that integrates with AI coding assistants to automate UI testing, regression checks, accessibility validation, and performance monitoring. It serves as the “eyes and hands” of AI code generators, executing natural language commands and translating them into browser-level tests.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Allow developers to describe UI behavior in natural language and have tests executed automatically.
- Catch regressions, accessibility issues, and performance bottlenecks early in development.
- Integrate seamlessly with major AI coding tools (Claude Code, Warp, Codex, etc.).
- Provide real-time feedback with actionable references to code and DOM elements.

---

## 3. Scope

The tool focuses on **frontend/UI validation** and **developer productivity**, not on backend testing or deployment automation.

Out of scope: load testing at scale, cross-device emulation beyond Playwright defaults, and backend service mocking.

---

## 4. User Stories Mapping

- **Natural Language UI Commands** → Translate plain English into Playwright automation.
- **Visual Regression Testing** → Automated screenshot diff with AI anomaly detection.
- **Accessibility Testing** → Automated WCAG, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility.
- **Performance Monitoring** → Lighthouse integration, Core Web Vitals tracking, AI recommendations.
- **Multi-Tool Integration** → Context sharing with AI coding assistants.
- **Continuous Testing Workflow** → Watch mode triggered on file changes with instant feedback.

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 High-Level Components

- **CLI Layer (TypeScript/Node.js)**
    - Command parsing
    - Developer interface
    - Reporting engine
- **Core Orchestrator (TypeScript + optional Rust)**
    - Orchestration of browser automation
    - Command-to-test translation
    - Test execution and result aggregation
- **Browser Automation Layer**
    - Playwright (cross-browser automation)
    - Chrome DevTools Protocol for low-level interactions
- **AI/ML Layer**
    - OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for command interpretation
    - LangChain/LlamaIndex for orchestration and memory
    - Local Ollama models for frequent ops
- **Testing & Analysis Modules**
    - Visual Regression → Playwright Screenshot API + Resemblyzer
    - Accessibility → Axe-core integration
    - Performance → Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals
- **Data Storage**
    - SQLite for local results, logs, and metrics
    - Vector DB (Chroma/Weaviate) for UI pattern retrieval
- **Integration Layer**
    - WebSocket server for real-time comms
    - JSON-RPC 2.0 for tool interoperability
    - MCP for Claude ecosystem compatibility

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Functional Requirements

1. Execute natural language commands and return pass/fail results.
2. Generate and compare screenshots between builds.
3. Run WCAG compliance checks and accessibility audits.
4. Integrate Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals monitoring.
5. Support watch mode for continuous testing.
6. Store results locally and provide historical comparisons.
7. Allow integration with multiple AI coding tools via standardized protocols.

### 6.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Execute tests with <2s overhead compared to manual Playwright tests.
- **Reliability:** Handle flaky tests with AI-driven wait/retry strategies.
- **Scalability:** Support up to 1000 test cases per project.
- **Security:** Run models locally when possible; cloud APIs require encrypted communication.
- **Usability:** CLI outputs must be human-readable and structured (JSON option available).

## 7. APIs & Interfaces

```tsx
interface UIOrchestrator {
  connect(tool: 'claude-code' | 'warp' | 'codex'): Promise<void>;
  launch(url: string, options?: LaunchOptions): Promise<BrowserContext>;
  execute(command: string): Promise<ExecutionResult>;
  assertVisual(selector: string, expectation: string): Promise<AssertionResult>;
  generateTests(page: Page): Promise<TestSuite>;
  watch(callback: (change: UIChange) => void): void;
}

```

- **CLI Commands:**
    - `orchestrator run "Make sure the login flow works"`
    - `orchestrator visual-diff --baseline=main`
    - `orchestrator accessibility-check /login`
    - `orchestrator perf-report /dashboard`
    - `orchestrator watch`

---

## 8. Data Storage Schema

**SQLite:**

- `test_results` (id, suite, command, status, timestamp, file_ref)
- `visual_diffs` (id, baseline_img, new_img, diff_score, severity)
- `accessibility_issues` (id, page, rule, severity, description)
- `perf_metrics` (id, url, metric, value, timestamp)

**Vector DB (Chroma/Weaviate):**

- `ui_patterns` (pattern_id, embedding, description, usage_count)

---

## 9. Success Metrics

- Reduce UI testing time by **80%**.
- Catch **95% of UI bugs** before manual testing.
- Non-technical stakeholders able to verify UI flows via natural language commands.
- Integration with **5+ major AI coding tools** within first release cycle.

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** High false positive rate in visual diffs.
    - **Mitigation:** Layer DOM heuristics with AI anomaly detection.
- **Risk:** AI misinterprets vague natural language commands.
    - **Mitigation:** Add fallback to explicit selectors with user confirmation.
- **Risk:** Performance overhead in large projects.
    - **Mitigation:** Caching, incremental rendering, selective AI evaluation.

---

## 11. Roadmap (Incremental Implementation)

- **Phase 1:** CLI with Playwright integration, natural language commands, watch mode.
- **Phase 2:** Visual regression testing + accessibility audits.
- **Phase 3:** Performance monitoring with Lighthouse + Core Web Vitals.
- **Phase 4:** Multi-tool integration (Claude, Codex, Warp).
- **Phase 5:** Advanced AI-driven learning (UI pattern recognition, automated test generation).

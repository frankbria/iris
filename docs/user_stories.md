# User Stories for AI-Driven UI Development Orchestrator

## Natural Language UI Commands

### Execute High-Level UI Commands

**User Statement:**

As a developer, I want to describe UI interactions in plain English, so that I can test behavior without writing detailed selectors or scripts.

**Description:**

Developers can issue commands like “Click the submit button and verify the form validates email format.” The system translates this into executable UI actions and test assertions.

**Success Criteria:**

- Developer inputs a plain English instruction.
- System executes the correct UI action in a browser.
- CLI returns feedback with pass/fail status and references to relevant code or DOM elements.

## Visual Regression Testing

### Detect Visual Changes Automatically

**User Statement:**

As a QA engineer, I want the system to detect visual anomalies between builds, so that I can identify breaking changes without manual screenshot comparison.

**Description:**

The system compares UI screenshots across versions, identifies visual differences, and distinguishes between acceptable and breaking changes using AI-driven heuristics.

**Success Criteria:**

- Automatic screenshot generation for each UI state.
- AI flags differences beyond acceptable thresholds.
- CLI outputs a report highlighting visual diffs with before/after images.

## Multi-Tool Integration

### Integrate with AI Code Tools

**User Statement:**

As a developer using AI assistants, I want my coding tool and UI testing tool to share context, so that I can streamline my workflow without switching environments.

**Description:**

The orchestrator integrates with tools like Claude Code, Warp, and Codex via standardized protocols (JSON-RPC, MCP).

**Success Criteria:**

- CLI establishes connection with multiple supported tools.
- Test results and AI-generated suggestions are shared across tools.
- Developers can run end-to-end tests within their existing coding environment.

## Continuous Testing Workflow

### Run Tests Continuously with Watch Mode

**User Statement:**

As a developer, I want continuous testing that reacts to code changes, so that I can catch bugs instantly during development.

**Description:**

The watch mode monitors code changes, reruns relevant tests, and streams results in real-time to the CLI.

**Success Criteria:**

- Code changes automatically trigger relevant tests.
- CLI displays real-time results with minimal latency.
- Developers receive specific file/line references for failures.

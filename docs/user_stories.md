# User Stories for IRIS - Interface Recognition & Interaction Suite

## Phase 1: Foundation Stories

### Natural Language UI Commands

#### Execute High-Level UI Commands

**User Statement:**

As a developer, I want to describe UI interactions in plain English, so that I can test behavior without writing detailed selectors or scripts.

**Description:**

Developers can issue commands like "Click the submit button and verify the form validates email format." The system translates this into executable UI actions and test assertions.

**Success Criteria:**

- Developer inputs a plain English instruction via `iris run "command"`
- System executes the correct UI action in a browser using Playwright
- CLI returns feedback with pass/fail status and references to relevant code or DOM elements
- Results are persisted to SQLite database with timestamps and execution details

**Priority:** P0 (Core functionality)

#### AI-Enhanced Command Translation

**User Statement:**

As a developer, I want the system to understand complex UI interactions through AI when simple pattern matching fails, so that I can describe sophisticated test scenarios naturally.

**Description:**

When regex-based translation cannot interpret a command, the system falls back to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs to understand intent and generate appropriate Playwright actions.

**Success Criteria:**

- System detects when pattern matching fails
- AI client translates complex commands into structured actions
- Fallback to explicit selectors with user confirmation when AI is uncertain
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
